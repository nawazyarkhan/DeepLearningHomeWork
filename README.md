The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:
